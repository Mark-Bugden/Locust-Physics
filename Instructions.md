# Instructions for VTK students

You will first need to download and install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
Once you have installed and opened Anaconda, you will want to install some programs to use. If you are on windows I recommend Powershell Prompt and Jupyter Lab (just click on the "Install" icon). 
If you are on Mac/Linux, you can probably just use the terminal, rather than install Powershell Prompt. 

### Now open Powershell Prompt and type the following commands.

To create a new environment:
(you can replace `myenv` with whatever name you like)

`
conda create --name myenv
`


Now activate your new environment by typing:

`
conda activate myenv
`

You should see the name of your environment `(myenv)` in brackets on the left. You will now need to install some packages. Start by installing pip, the package installer.

`
conda install pip
`

Then you can install the other required packages:
`
pip install pandas
`

`
pip install matplotlib
`

`
pip install numpy
`

`
pip install seaborn
`

`
pip install scipy
`

`
pip install scikit-guess
`
